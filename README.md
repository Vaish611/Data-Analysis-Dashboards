# IBM Data Dashboard
## Project Overview
Developed an interactive IBM HR Analytics Dashboard in Power BI to analyze employee demographics and departmental performance. Built horizontal bar, stacked bar, pie, and line charts to visualize income, employee count, and age-based trends. Used Power BI aggregation functions to calculate average income, total employees, gender-wise income, and department headcount. Implemented slicers for Marital Status, Education Field, and Business Travel for dynamic filtering across employee segments. Enhanced data storytelling with professional layout, gender-coded colors, and clear labels for HR decisionmaking.

### KPIs Questions
1.What is the gender distribution and pay gap across all departments?
2.Which job role has the highest average monthly income and how does it vary by gender?
3.What is the total employee headcount and departmental distribution?
4.How does average monthly rate vary across different age groups?
5.Which education field shows the highest job satisfaction levels?

### Process
1.Collected and cleaned employee dataset including demographics, salary, department, age, education, and job satisfaction metrics from IBM HR records.
2.Imported the data into Power BI and established data relationships, created calculated fields for averages, sums, and percentage distributions.
3.Designed interactive visualizations with bar charts for income analysis, pie charts for departmental distribution, stacked bars for gender comparison, and line charts for age-based trends.
4.Implemented dynamic filters for MaritalStatus, EducationField, and BusinessTravel to enable user-driven data exploration and analysis.
5.Validated all calculations and metrics to ensure data accuracy, then documented KPI questions and insights for GitHub repository upload.

### Project Insights
1.Gender Pay Gap - Males earn significantly more across all departments, with the largest gap in R&D (59.10% vs 40.90%) and Sales (57.54% vs 42.46%).
2.R&D Dominance - R&D accounts for 65.37% of employees and the highest payroll, making it the organization's core department.
3.Compensation Trends - Managers earn ~17K while entry-level roles earn ~3K; monthly rates peak at mid-career (ages 25-35) then decline after 55.
4.Job Satisfaction - Life Sciences (42.26%) and Human Resources (31.14%) fields show highest satisfaction levels.

### Conclusion 
The dashboard reveals critical gender pay inequity requiring immediate HR attention, R&D as the cost-driving department, and age-based compensation patterns that may create retention risks for senior talent approaching retirement.
